CP132 Lab 2

In this lab, you’ll get some practice in writing Java.

Specifications

Each question will have its own project in the assignment repository.

1) (3 pts) Write a program that allows the user to enter a value for one edge of a cube. The program
calculates the surface area of one side of the cube, the surface area of the cube, and its volume. The
program outputs all the results.

2) (3 pts) Write a program that takes a student's score (out of 100) as input and calculates their letter
grade. Use the standard grading scale (A, B, C, D, F). Output the student’s letter grade.

3) (2 pts) Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year or not. Prompt the user to
input a year, and output whether it's a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.

4) (4 pts) Draw a program for the following problem:
Wall-Mart is trying to inspire their sales staff to sell more bricks. If an employee sells more than
$1399.99, they receive a free pack of gum. Draw the flowchart for one employee. The employee will input every item they sell, irrespective of
whether it is a brick or not. Your program will take the item and cost of the item as inputs. Only bricks
count towards the reward! Loop until the employee wins their prize and output a congratulatory
message. The congratulatory message should be the only output in your program.

5) (3 pts) Write a program that calculates the projected cost of a remodeling project. Assume that the
labor cost is $30 per hour. Prompt the user for the number of hours projected for the job and the
wholesale cost of materials. The program computes and displays the cost of the job, which is the
number of hours times the hourly rate plus the 120% of the wholesale cost of materials. The program
will keep calculating costs until 0 is entered for the number of hours.

Constraints
 Prompt the user before every input.
◦ Ex: “Enter a noun: ”
 Echo every input.
◦ Ex: “You entered ‘table’.”
 Close the input Scanner when there are no more inputs.
 Utilize named constant variables.

Submission
The submission for this lab is the commit ID you want to be graded. You will submit it via the Canvas
assignment.
Points will be assigned by correctness and your observable understanding as reflected in your code.
